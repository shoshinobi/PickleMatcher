## üìñ How It Works

### The Algorithm
PickleMatcher uses a sophisticated scoring system to create balanced matches:

- **Prioritizes players with fewer games** to ensure equal playing time
- **Penalizes repeated partnerships** using exponential scoring
- **Balances team strengths** for competitive matches
- **Handles odd numbers** by rotating who sits out

### Data Storage
- **Players**: Stored in Google Sheets "Players" tab
- **Schedule**: Saved as JSON in hidden "ScheduleData" tab
- **Statistics**: Visible in "Stats" tab and in-app display

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Single Group Usage**: This app should only be used by one group at a time
- **Clearing Players**: This action affects all users and resets everything
- **Minimum Players**: You need at least 4 players to generate matches
- **Optimal Size**: Works best with 6-12 players
